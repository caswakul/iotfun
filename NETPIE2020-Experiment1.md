## Let's Start

1. Sign-up and log-in with your username and password at netpie.io

![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116225106.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116225106.png)

Here, I enter my email.  You have to use your own email.
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116225329.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116225329.png)

2. Once in NETPIE web, create your own project and enter your project description.

![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116230208.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116230208.png)

As a new project, it contains no devices and groups yet.
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116230248.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116230248.png)

3. Devices within the same group can communicate with each other. So, let us enter menu 'Group' and create new groups. You can name and add description to your new groups. Here, I create 2 groups, named 'myoffice' and 'myhome'. 
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116230832.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116230832.png)
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116231047.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116231047.png)
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116231107.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116231107.png)

4. Enter menu 'Devices'. Create devices. Here, I create 4 devices, 'homeDev1' and 'homeDev2' in group 'myhome'; and  'officeDev1' and 'officeDev2' in group 'myoffice'. For example, for 'homeDev1' in group 'myhome':
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116232641.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116232641.png)

Completing all 4 devices, you get the following device list:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116233235.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116233235.png)

 NETPIE creates for each of your devices the client ID, token, secret. You will need to use these keys to authenticate your devices to ask for an authorised access into NETPIE. For instance, my 'homeDev1' gets assigned the following key:
 ![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230116234645.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230116234645.png)
 
You can click 'Copy' at each of the key values, to copy the string, which will be used later on with your code or program that implements that device.

5. Following reference tutorial of NETPIE, let us use MQTTBox to emulate NETPIE devices. First, install MQTTbox. For instance, here I have installed MQTTBox from the Chrome Web Store. 
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117000036.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117000036.png)

Once launching MQTTBox, we get:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117000318.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117000318.png)

6. In MQTTBox, click 'Create MQTT Client'. As an example, for 'homeDev1', the following input values are entered:

==MQTTBox Input Values for 'homeDev1' ==

| ==MQTT CLIENT SETTINGS==  | ==INPUT VALUES==                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| MQTT Client Name     | any string                           |
| MQTT Client Id       | 'Client ID' of 'homeDev1' in NETPIE  |
| Protocol             | mqtt / tcp                           |
| Host                 | broker.netpie.io                     |
| Username             | 'token' of 'homeDev1' in NETPIE      |
| Append timestamp to MQTT client id? | no                    |
*NB: other settings are default*

![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117000829.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117000829.png)

Click 'Save' to finish creating 'homeDev1' as our 1st MQTT client. We will get:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117002947.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117002947.png)

Here, all the input settings are correct. So, the device can successfully connect to NETPIE. We can also see the 'online' status of this 'homeDev1' from NETPIE directly:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117005409.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117005409.png)


7. Now we have one MQTT client 'homeDev1' already connected successfully with NETPIE. Let us try to have this device send a message to NETPIE. By MQTT, recall that we shall use the MQTT publish/subscribe communication model. Suppose we want this client to subscribe to a topic, say 'homeAnnouncements'. We can enter the topic text with prefix '@msg/' defined by the NETPIE2020 convention. This prefix is intended in NETPIE for *text* message communications.
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117004612.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117004612.png)

And click 'Subscribe'. We get:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117004644.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117004644.png)


8. Suppose 'homeDev1' wants to publish a message to topic 'homeAnnouncements' as well. You can enter:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117004837.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117004837.png)

And click 'Publish' to publish the message. Here, I enter the message payload as merely a text string. We get:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117005055.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117005055.png)

9. That is great. A good thing about NETPIE2020 is its centralised managability of created devices. Suppose you want to disallow 'homeDev1' from NETPIE. You can click to toggle from 'enable' to 'disable':
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117010404.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117010404.png)

And we now get from NETPIE the 'Offline' status for this device:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117010452.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117010452.png)

And in MQTTBox, we notice 'Connection Error' happens then for 'homeDev1'.
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117010620.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117010620.png)

If we persist in trying to publish a message again during this 'Connection Error' from MQTTBox of this device:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117010849.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117010849.png)

We get error message:
![NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted image 20230117010942.png](NETPIE2020-Experiment1-assets/Pasted%20image%2020230117010942.png)

Likewise, a subscribe attempt would also fail. From NETPIE, try 'enable' this device once more. And check that publish/subscribe of this device can resume.

## Excercise 1A

Recall that we have initially created 4 devices in 2 groups. And we have demonstrated above pub/sub from only one device so far.

Can you try to verify that devices within the same group can communicate via pub/sub with each other?  For instance, you can configure device 'homeDev2' and have it subscribed to the topic 'homeAnnouncements'. Then you can test whether 'homeDev2' gets the messages that are published to this topic by 'homeDev1'.


## Exercise 1B

Likewise, can you try to verify that devices from different groups cannot communication via pub/sub with each other?  For instance, you can device 'officeDev1' and have it subscribed to the topic 'homeAnnouncements'. Then you can test whether 'officeDev1' gets the messages that are published to this topic by 'homeDev1'.


## Exercise 1C

Notice that there are other options in MQTT Client Settings that we have not used yet e.g. last-will and retain. Can you try to design your own experiments to test the functionality of those MQTT features.


## Exercise 1D

Finally, this is a bit challenging experimental design. Can you try to test the functionality of 'QoS' settings in MQTT. It can be such a challenge because you might not be easily able to control how messages are lost during the transmission. Use load generator?  Use Wireshark?  Any idea here?
